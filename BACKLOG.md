# Backlog

Every open item from every source (Ersagun's asks, reviews, QA passes,
bigger-program rounds, design notes), in one place. Finished items are in
[DONE.md](docs/process/DONE.md). How items are picked and run is in
[WORKFLOW.md](docs/process/WORKFLOW.md); every doc is listed in [the docs index](docs/README.md).

Each lane's items are grouped by theme. Within a lane, priority (P1 first)
decides what's next, and "Next up" below names it in a line: what's next,
never what's done (that goes to DONE.md).

**Priority:** P0 broken now · P1 blocks the current step or Ersagun asked ·
P2 next steps · P3 nice to have. Within a priority: bugs, then removing a
special case, then what lets programs be written in the editor, then
language, then more targets or speed (WORKFLOW.md "Priority").
Rows once held back as later goals are open again (Ersagun 2026-11-09):
a lane takes them when bugs and goal rows are in hand.
Focus since 2026-11-10 14:49 (Ersagun): finish stable references, free lists and multithreading (P1 rows C58, C60, C61, C43; C42, C57, C59 and C200 closed 2026-11-12 as waiting for an example, DONE.md); mobile rows are down to P3.
Defaults first (Ersagun 2026-11-10 15:34): "I want the default compiled code to be as close to a C/C++ dev doing data oriented design and cache and memory aware as possible. And then if we need Pools and similar stuff to get a last 10 percent of performance that's OK, but the defaults should be our first target." So rows that change what every program gets (layout as columns, arrays written in place, records changed in place, work on every core) go before ones a program must ask for (a Pool type).
**Size:** S hours · M one PR · L several PRs or a design note first.
**Status:** ▶ running · ⏸ held · blank = waiting.

## Next up

| lane | thread | next, in order |
|---|---|---|
| E Editor | "Editor lane" | C58 (free lists; a Pool type asked of Ersagun); mobile rows wait. Then Language or Compiler rows agreed with those lanes |
| C Compiler and targets | "Compiler lane" | C187 is blocked on V8; C195 is done (#2515) |
| L Language and library | "Language lane" | the next goal row (stable references, free lists, multithreading) agreed with the lane that holds it; I203's editor half is with the Editor lane (L182 is with the Editor lane) |
| L Language and library | "Language lane B" | the next goal row agreed with its lane (C43's first on C waits for an example); round 12's I187 is with the Editor lane. Skip L107 (waits on Ersagun) and L24 (research). Take a row from another list only after telling that lane. |
| T Testing | "Replace the slow browser smoke test" | I64, then the smoke's replacement |

### Bugs and gaps found by programs

| I221 | Compiled relational streams (C195h) nest one bind per level, and forcing a pause goes through all of them: reading back 10,000 numbers on WebAssembly (examples/backwards' read numbers, its fuel raised) overflows the stack, and the time grows faster than n (0.2 s at 2,000, 1.2 s at 5,000). relate.ts had the same problem and fixed it by keeping the goals after a suspension as data (L18; laterOf since L24). Compiled code needs the same: a pause carries the binds waiting on it as data, not as closures nested inside each other. Example: 20,000 numbers read back on WASM and C as `ters run` reads them ([RESEARCH-L24-2026-11-12](docs/reports/RESEARCH-L24-2026-11-12.md) §3) | L24 | P2 | M | |
