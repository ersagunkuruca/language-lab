# Backlog

Every open item from every source (Ersagun's asks, reviews, QA passes,
bigger-program rounds, design notes), in one place. Finished items are in
[DONE.md](docs/process/DONE.md). How items are picked and run is in
[WORKFLOW.md](docs/process/WORKFLOW.md); every doc is listed in [the docs index](docs/README.md).

Each lane's items are grouped by theme. Within a lane, priority (P1 first)
decides what's next, and "Next up" below names it in a line: what's next,
never what's done (that goes to DONE.md).

**Priority:** P0 broken now · P1 blocks the current step or Ersagun asked ·
P2 next steps · P3 nice to have. Within a priority: bugs, then removing a
special case, then what lets programs be written in the editor, then
language, then more targets or speed (WORKFLOW.md "Priority").
Rows once held back as later goals are open again (Ersagun 2026-11-09):
a lane takes them when bugs and goal rows are in hand.
Focus since 2026-11-10 14:49 (Ersagun): finish stable references, free lists and multithreading (P1 rows C58, C60, C61, C43; C42, C57, C59 and C200 closed 2026-11-12 as waiting for an example, DONE.md); mobile rows are down to P3.
Defaults first (Ersagun 2026-11-10 15:34): "I want the default compiled code to be as close to a C/C++ dev doing data oriented design and cache and memory aware as possible. And then if we need Pools and similar stuff to get a last 10 percent of performance that's OK, but the defaults should be our first target." So rows that change what every program gets (layout as columns, arrays written in place, records changed in place, work on every core) go before ones a program must ask for (a Pool type).
**Size:** S hours · M one PR · L several PRs or a design note first.
**Status:** ▶ running · ⏸ held · blank = waiting.

## Next up

| lane | thread | next, in order |
|---|---|---|
| E Editor | "Editor lane" | C58 (free lists; a Pool type asked of Ersagun); mobile rows wait. Then Language or Compiler rows agreed with those lanes |
| C Compiler and targets | "Compiler lane" | C187 is blocked on V8; C195 is done (#2515) |
| L Language and library | "Language lane" | the next goal row (stable references, free lists, multithreading) agreed with the lane that holds it; I203's editor half is with the Editor lane (L182 is with the Editor lane) |
| L Language and library | "Language lane B" | the next goal row agreed with its lane (C43's first on C waits for an example); round 12's I187 is with the Editor lane. Skip L107 (waits on Ersagun) and L24 (research). Take a row from another list only after telling that lane. |
| T Testing | "Replace the slow browser smoke test" | T15 (P0: Check main finishes), then I64, then the smoke's replacement |

## Inbox

New items land here until the next triage gives them a lane and a priority.

| id | item | source | added |
|---|---|---|---|
| I219 | What the full run fails on, on main (2026-11-12; draws fixed in I219a, board, effects and finite in I219b, lang.test's palette sweep, map-tree.test's timing and C42h's names in c-names.test in I219 part, palette in I219c, the editor's shaders ("process is not defined") in I219d, the smoke's first-steps check (it waited for main, but a first visit opens on fall since E235) in I219e, the rest of the smoke (Countdown's solutions read [] once relate's settles spent steps) in I219f, fixed.test's CORDIC and core-js.test's pig in I219 part 2, each file run alone; the nightly hasn't passed since 10-28): on CI resolve-once.test (a kept library resolving typed `List Case several` where it is `List a`), passing here; likely the same cause as CORDIC (a kept resolving read over another library check), fixed by part 2, for the next Nightly to confirm. | I208 | 2026-11-12 |
| I239 | (Design: docs/design/tools/WORLD-LOG-WINDOW.md, steps I239a to I239f; all built but the buttons: the page panel's Pause, step back and step on over `steps`, and over `page.now.stepFrom` once the compiled page has taken over (Editor lane).) A run's log of the world's answers within bounded memory (Ersagun 2026-11-13: "it's still a memory hole"). Each world effect says how it is recorded: random as one seed for the run (our generator, seeded once from the world), the clock once per frame as a difference from the last reading. The log is kept as a window: a snapshot of the page's state every N seconds, older entries dropped, replay and step-back going as far back as the window. Prior art: rr's checkpoints, Redux DevTools' maxAge. Design note first. Example: tumble running an hour in the editor with its log under a fixed size, and step-back working inside the window. Suggested lane: Language | thread "Decide the saved program format"; worldlog.ts | 2026-11-13 |
| I241 | A trial repository holding one real Ters program, to try the format and `ters diff` in real git use: edits on two branches touching the same definitions, PRs read in GitHub's raw view and with `ters diff`, merges with and without the driver, findings in a dated report. Needs Ersagun to create the repository. After I240 | thread "Decide the saved program format" | 2026-11-13 |
| I251 | Before a merge, run what `node ters/test/affected.ts origin/main --list` lists for the files changed, not a set picked by hand; the coordinator tells the lane whose merge first turned Check main red. WORKFLOW.md "Doing an item" says so. (Main was red 11:58 to 13:50 on 11-13 through about eight merges, from L244's −0, and hid a second red.) Suggested lane: coordinator and all lanes; S, process | [REVIEW-2026-11-13](docs/reports/reviews/REVIEW-2026-11-13.md) §1 | 2026-11-13 |
| I253 | The handover to the compiled page tested as the editor does it, in a browser: the site's prebuilt page (prebuild.ts), the startup swap and the swap after a pause. (The lost cells' cause, each bundle's own cell symbol, fixed in I253a, and tested in Node from the runtime's bundle; the browser test is what's left.) Suggested lane: Editor, with Language; M | [REVIEW-2026-11-13](docs/reports/reviews/REVIEW-2026-11-13.md) §3 | 2026-11-13 |
| I254 | WORLD-LOG-WINDOW.md's cost example measured on a page that hears frames (bounce), not tumble, which animates with CSS. Suggested lane: Language; S, docs | [REVIEW-2026-11-13](docs/reports/reviews/REVIEW-2026-11-13.md) §4 | 2026-11-13 |
