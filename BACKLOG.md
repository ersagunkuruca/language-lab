# Backlog

Every open item from every source (Ersagun's asks, reviews, QA passes,
bigger-program rounds, design notes), in one place. Finished items are in
[DONE.md](docs/process/DONE.md). How items are picked and run is in
[WORKFLOW.md](docs/process/WORKFLOW.md); every doc is listed in [the docs index](docs/README.md).

Each lane's items are grouped by theme. Within a lane, priority (P1 first)
decides what's next, and "Next up" below names it in a line: what's next,
never what's done (that goes to DONE.md).

**Priority:** P0 broken now · P1 blocks the current step or Ersagun asked ·
P2 next steps · P3 nice to have. Within a priority: bugs, then removing a
special case, then what lets programs be written in the editor, then
language, then more targets or speed (WORKFLOW.md "Priority").
**Size:** S hours · M one PR · L several PRs or a design note first.
**Status:** ▶ running · ⏸ held · blank = waiting.

## Next up

| lane | thread | next, in order |
|---|---|---|
| E Editor | "Editor lane" | E237 (after L204), E103 (after infer.ts's idea) |
| C Compiler and targets | "Compiler lane" | C30, C93 |
| L Language and library | "Language lane" | next by priority from the table below |
| T Testing | "Replace the slow browser smoke test" | I64, then the smoke's replacement |

## Inbox

New items land here until the next triage gives them a lane and a priority.

| id | item | source | added |
|---|---|---|---|
| I167 | + New definition freezes the editor. Example: Create of `extra(x)` on Insertion sort; done when it runs in tasks of at most 0.1 s. Left: the edit's own task, about 0.23 s in node (the check, the inspector and the Run panel). Was 1.3 to 1.8 s; what took it down is in DONE.md (I167b to I167l) | QA 11-04 L1 | 2026-11-04 |

| E103 | **Bug.** Adding a value in a definition run backwards is slow (five stages and E133, E103c to e and L226 so far, DONE.md). Example: physics `fall`'s holes, 72 s for all 23 and the worst 18 s (2026-11-05); its 8 call holes 119 to 34 s from cold, the worst 41 to 14.5 s, by refusing offers the callers can't use before a whole check (E103f), and before their plans are worked out (E103g: on main since, 37 to 23 s, the worst 16 to 5.9 s); done when the worst takes under a second. Left: the plans compared per offer (solveMode, about 4 ms each, 2,019 for one hole with 7 distinct answers) and the checks of the group. Next idea: where only a plan changes, check the solves' verdicts instead of a whole inference (reusing a verdict across callees needs a fingerprint of the callee's modes, not cheap and sound yet) | E100 | P3 | M | |

### Foundations ([FOUNDATIONS-2026-11-03](docs/reports/reviews/FOUNDATIONS-2026-11-03.md), in fix order)

| id | item | source | pri | size | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C176 | Bug: < at Text through a definition of your own (`earlier(a, b) = if b < a then b else a`, given Texts) stops as a Float64's overflow in the core IR's JavaScript; the evaluator gives the earlier text. Example: ters/test/text-ordered.test.ts, whose assertion then says the evaluator's lines | C137 r5 | P1 | S | |
| C177 | Bug: a direction's solve (directions.test.ts: unpolar given as polar's direction) finds no answer in the core IR's JavaScript, where the evaluator gives "2 1.570796327". Example: ters/test/directions.test.ts, whose assertion then says the evaluator's answer | C137 r5 | P1 | S | |
| C178 | Bug: `all(seeded(9, search))`, seeded inside a search that draws, gives other draws in the core IR's JavaScript ([917, 753, 754]) than the evaluator ([917, 812, 963], the same as seeded around the search). Example: compiler/test/effects.test.ts "Random: seeded draws", which asserts the answers differ until this is fixed | C137 r6 | P1 | S | |
| C179 | Bug: pages on the core IR's JavaScript differ from the evaluator's: a view waiting for its fetch shows the wait's message where the evaluator's shows nothing, and a formula that never ends runs on (no steps stop it, where the evaluator's part says it didn't finish). Example: compiler/test/web.test.ts "fetching in a page", which asserts the pages differ until this is fixed, and "a formula that never ends", drawn by the evaluator only until then | C137 r6 | P1 | M | |
| C139 | Library types out of the core passes. Example: Extended shows the same on every target through its own Shown. Left: Extended's and the algebras' show (they have no Shown yet). | [FOUNDATIONS-2026-11-03](docs/reports/reviews/FOUNDATIONS-2026-11-03.md) §7 | P3 | M | |

### Speed of compiled code

| id | item | source | pri | size | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C175 | Tidy the scalar printer's output (WGSL, and the core IR's other printers that share it). Example: raymarch's WGSL (511 lines). Left: drop the 24 `let a = b` copies; fold negations (`-(-x)`, `a + (-(b))`); share what the gradient's per-axis copies have in common (`sin(0.7 · t)` is computed 20 times); build only the parts of `Pga_2` that are read; work out the time-only motor once per frame, not per pixel | Ersagun 2026-11-05 12:38 (Learn thread: the ray marcher) | P2 | M | |
| C93 | Lists read and written by position stay cons lists (primes 20000 compiled 47.9 s against 43 ms ideal); steps 1 to 3, (c) and s1 to s3b done (DONE.md). Example: machine's primes 20000 on JavaScript, aim 0.11 s (155 ms now on the core IR, split lists); done when it gets there. Left: (s4) that, and a cost for the split against the trees. WebAssembly and C keep trees until arrays are replaced in place there (C56) | [GAPS round 9](docs/reports/GAPS.md#round-9-machine-an-assembler-and-interpreter-on-every-target-2026-11-02) M1 | P3 | L | |
| C30 | Lists as arrays, chosen from use (REPRESENTATIONS.md); the JavaScript stages, Ersagun's two-ended arrays on every target, and s1 to s2c2 done (DONE.md). Example: chapters' word count stored as arrays on WebAssembly and C as on JavaScript (s3); done when it runs there no slower than its cons lists. Beyond it, a row if it earns one: block-in-array (s4), measured first | GAPS.md round 4 P4 | P2 | L | |

### Memory and layout (STABLE-REFERENCES.md §3 to §6)

All invisible to programs: no annotations or hints (Ersagun 2026-10-29).

| id | item | source | pri | size | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C56 | "Owned, in place" as a representation chosen when a value has one holder, generalising `$own` and C30 to records, maps and cell contents; reference counts (Perceus) where the compiler can't tell. Steps are C62, C63 | STABLE-REFERENCES.md §3 | P3 | L | |
| C57 | A region per scope: temporaries of one page update, audio block or frame freed at once (Tofte–Talpin) | STABLE-REFERENCES.md §4 | P3 | L | |
| C58 | Keyed collections as a grow-only array with a free list and generational keys (ECS) | STABLE-REFERENCES.md §4 | P3 | M | |
| C59 | Flat inline layout for data built once and read, doubling as a file format (FlatBuffers). Measured on notebook after C71/C72 (GAPS.md round 6, N3: about 10% left for it there, 4.4× the ideal with no one hotspot): its index is built once with one holder (8.5× the ideal on trees) and then only read by every question (8×); a frozen map as sorted key and value arrays makes `entries of` free and `value at` a binary search | STABLE-REFERENCES.md §4, GAPS.md round 6 N3 | P3 | M | after C70, C71 |
| C60 | **Later goal**: a list of records stored as columns when its loops read few fields | STABLE-REFERENCES.md §5 | P3 | L | |
| C61 | **Later goal**: where code runs chosen by cost, never written (workers, GPU compute, main thread). First step: read Bend 2 and write the design note | STABLE-REFERENCES.md §6 | P3 | L | |

| L182 | Flags as hidden kinds: new attributes go through the schema (a), `def.results`, a field's `results` and `def.direction` gone (b, c1, c2; DONE.md). Example: `field.ports` gone, a field's port names read from its own type (c3); done when it is. Waits for function types' parameters to have names, since directions pair fields by them (L182c3 in DONE) | [FOUNDATIONS-2026-11-03](docs/reports/reviews/FOUNDATIONS-2026-11-03.md) §8 | P3 | M | |

### Ersagun's current asks

| id | item | source | pri | size | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L107 | **Open question, not decided** (Ersagun 2026-10-30: "I didn't ask to lift strict positivity BTW, I'm not sure if we should lift that"): drop strict positivity, so a data type may take itself as a function's input in its fields (`knot = wrap(f: knot → Float64)`), with taking one apart carrying Diverge so a function without Diverge still always finishes. Recursive data types themselves (a type holding itself, directly or through others) are allowed and always were; TUTORIAL.md §3.8 says so. If decided yes: LANGUAGE.md "Two rules", TUTORIAL.md §3.8 and the guarantees test | Ersagun 2026-10-30 | P3 | S | open question |

### Numbers (NUMBERS.md)

| id | item | source | pri | size | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L207 | The number types leave std.ts for the `numbers` module written in the language (numbers-source.ts), ids kept for saved programs (L184). Dual, Complex, Mat2 to Mat4, Matrix and Fixed done (L207a to L207e). Example: Rational, with its + − · ÷ <, Literal, Shown and embeddings, is the module's and std.ts names it nowhere; done when it is (run.ts, relate.ts, signs.ts, infer.ts, list-tree.ts, map-tree.ts and scalar.ts still name RATIO or RATIONAL_TYPE; compile.ts goes with C137). Left after it: Algebra, Table entry, Trig, Extended, each its own row if it earns one. Algebraic stays host code | [MATHEMATICS-AS-LIBRARIES](docs/design/numbers/MATHEMATICS-AS-LIBRARIES-2026-11-03.md) | P3 | L | Dual, Complex, Mat2 to Mat4, Matrix, Fixed done |
| L209 | Values stored in the smallest structure they stay in, chosen by the compiler through embeddings. Example: a Complex with no imaginary part kept as a Float64 in compiled code (EMBEDDINGS.md L208f, C lane, after L43c). Anything beyond it (a rotor as a quaternion, masks for std's own tables) needs its own row. Showing an inserted embedding in the editor is asked of Ersagun first | [MATHEMATICS-AS-LIBRARIES](docs/design/numbers/MATHEMATICS-AS-LIBRARIES-2026-11-03.md) | P3 | L | |
| L44 | Linear maps, geometry and matrices ([MATRICES.md](docs/design/numbers/MATRICES.md)). Example: a program's rotation function compiled as a matrix product. Left: the compiler stores linear functions as matrices (C lane, C30b/c) | LANGUAGE-REVIEW-2026-10-24 | P1 | M | a-g done |
| L43 | Grades as types ([GRADES.md](docs/design/numbers/GRADES.md)): rotors, blade masks, mask tables, staging by mask, the editor's mask names and masks as types done (L43a to L43e3, DONE.md). Example: Bounce, which passes vectors, spins and rotors as one 8-part type; done when it stores only each value's masked parts in compiled JS and WGSL (L43c, with the copies staging makes). Beyond it, a row if it earns one: the editor naming an input's mask in its type (L43e) | NUMBERS.md stage 4, [CLIFFORD-DEMOS](docs/reports/CLIFFORD-DEMOS-2026-10-31.md) B3 | P1 | L | rotors and masks done |
| L118c | The evaluator compiles each definition to JavaScript closures once (closure compilation, Feeley and Lapalme 1987), keeping the heap continuation only where a search or a handler needs it; likely 3-10x on all interpreted code; notebook's Run takes 3.2 s for 100 notes, half of it the evaluator's own machine (GAPS.md round 6 N6) ([EVALUATOR-SPEED-2026-10-31.md](docs/reports/EVALUATOR-SPEED-2026-10-31.md) step 2). For later: Ersagun stopped L118 after step 2 | Ersagun 2026-10-31 | P3 | L | for later |
| L88 | Exact reals ([EXACT-REALS.md](docs/design/numbers/EXACT-REALS.md)). Example: `real less than` at Real answers with Diverge instead of fuel. Left: that one <, when a program asks for it | Ersagun 2026-10-26 | P2 | L | e1-e5 done |

### Data and representations (DATA-STRUCTURES.md, REPRESENTATIONS.md)

| id | item | source | pri | size | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L212 | A hash array mapped trie for Map and Set, and RRB vectors (32-wide) for `tree of List`, as further representations ([DATA-STRUCTURES.md](docs/design/data/DATA-STRUCTURES.md) "Later representations"): only when a program measures the need, as C63's hash tables did. Credit Bagwell (HAMT, 2001) and Bagwell and Rompf (RRB, 2012), prior art | L61's rest | P3 | M | |
| L98 | A cell owns its value and a write is an edit at a path (STABLE-REFERENCES.md §1): positions done (L98a), keys done (L98b, `key path`). Next: the in-place store is C56's representation | Ersagun 2026-10-29 | P2 | L | steps 1, 2 done |
| L101 | **Later goal**: multithreading where uniqueness allows it (rayon), effect rows deciding what runs side by side (§5) | Ersagun 2026-10-29 | P3 | L | |
| L21 | Folds: a `build` row for user producers, folds with `Choice` asking the table | ROADMAP 5 | P3 | L | |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L69 | Foreign definitions ([FOREIGN.md](docs/design/targets/FOREIGN.md)). Example: one of std's world operations (the clock) answered by `hosts/js.js` instead of the evaluator's own code. Left: L69d (optional), std's world operations as host files. Asks Ersagun: may a foreign operation be declared pure | LANGUAGE-NEEDS §5 | P2 | M | a-c done |

| L72 | JSON as one relation: `json spelled` gives every spelling, `json read` is it run backwards (a to f done, DONE.md). Example: `json printed` is `json spelled`'s first on every target (e1d); done when it is. It waits for the core IR to run a `first` of a Choice without nesting the rest in it: 300 records run out of stack now, though the evaluator prints them in 0.29 s. Beyond it, rows if they earn them: json read's message saying where it stopped (f3), `json printed indented` as a variant (e4) | Ersagun 2026-10-24 | P3 | L | low priority |
| L17 | Data-type upgrades (migrations when constructors and fields move); path namespaces are a name layer (SHARING.md §5) | ROADMAP 5 | P3 | L | |
| L109 | Hashes carry a recipe version; std published with lineages and versions, so a std change adds versions and keeps the old (no more #709-style republishing) | SHARING.md §3 | P3 | M | |
| L110 | Publishing keeps the draft id as the lineage id; refs hold lineage and exact version; `replaces` derived from the lineage | SHARING.md §1, §2 | P3 | M | after L109 |
| L111 | Upgrades by pin generality (new pin at least as general), moved by the editor with a note; Bob's tests must pass once T7 exists | SHARING.md §2 | P3 | M | after L110 |
| L112 | Names pinned per program; one question per upgrade for the author's renames; the program's own renames win | SHARING.md §5 | P3 | M | after L110 |
| L115 | Project store: every published node the project used, kept by hash with it by default; runs when a source is gone; downgrade to any kept version (Ersagun 2026-10-31) | SHARING.md §4b | P3 | M | after L110 |
| L114 | Lineage logs: signed, append-only, "current" and "broken" entries; code fetched by hash from any host; a browser over logs (was L68) | SHARING.md §4 | P3 | L | after L111 |

### Physics and planning ([PHYSICS-AND-PLANNING.md](docs/design/physics/PHYSICS-AND-PLANNING.md), later goals)

Ersagun 2026-11-01: fast bodies passing through each other, and A* for an
agent with inertia. All later goals.

| id | item | source | pri | size | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| L120 | **Later goal**: time of impact for rotating shapes along a PGA motor (screw motion) by conservative advancement (Mirtich); the compiler choosing it or the closed form by cost (WAYS.md) | Ersagun 2026-11-01 | P3 | L | shapes other than balls |
| L122 | **Later goal**: an agent with inertia, decoupled: navigation-mesh A* (from routes' frontier), the funnel, corners as arcs, the time-optimal speed profile (forward and backward pass), a follower; one page, a hand-made mesh | Ersagun 2026-11-01 | P3 | L | |
| L123 | **Later goal**: the coupled search: Hybrid A*-style over position and velocity, motion primitives exact under linear drag, L122's path length / top speed as the heuristic; compared with L122 on the same map | Ersagun 2026-11-01 | P3 | L | after L122 |
| L124 | **Later goal**: a rapidity speed cap (velocity as a boost in Cl(2, 1)) beside linear drag on L122's page; optional | Ersagun 2026-11-01 | P3 | M | after L122 |

Left: the graph's wire values running fall backwards after each pick (editor/main.ts traceInputs), resolving arith.ts for each version's search was 8 of its 34 s (2026-11-05 17:00): the library's resolving seed was never made after #1860, fixed by #1928, 27 s since. Of the 27, the palettes' whole checks are 6 s: 266 checks, 213 of them refused because the filling breaks the held definition's pin ("is pinned to (a, a, a) -> a …, and this makes it (Float64, …)"). Those are refused before the check now (E103h): swapAndUndo 27 to 24 s. Beyond it, a row each if they earn one: the next slowest file (swapAndUndo 29 s on main at 18:20: its two pages each check the library once, no repeat; the rest is drawing's types 4.2 s and the palettes' whole checks 3.6 s; simplifyAppend 14 to 12 s by T14n: a value written into a hole was checked with no options, so the library was checked a second time; listItems 12.0 s, implementInterface 13.5 to 5.9 s by T14o: a click on a side link that isn't there waited 5 s and was caught silently; the file's other silent catches don't wait), measured by stage | [TEST-SPEED-2026-11-03](docs/reports/TEST-SPEED-2026-11-03.md) | P3 | M | |
