# Backlog

Every open item from every source (Ersagun's asks, reviews, QA passes,
bigger-program rounds, design notes), in one place. Finished items are in
[DONE.md](docs/process/DONE.md). How items are picked and run is in
[WORKFLOW.md](docs/process/WORKFLOW.md); every doc is listed in [the docs index](docs/README.md).

Each lane's items are grouped by theme. Within a lane, priority (P1 first)
decides what's next, and "Next up" below names it in a line: what's next,
never what's done (that goes to DONE.md).

**Priority:** P0 broken now · P1 blocks the current step or Ersagun asked ·
P2 next steps · P3 nice to have. Within a priority: bugs, then removing a
special case, then what lets programs be written in the editor, then
language, then more targets or speed (WORKFLOW.md "Priority").
Rows once held back as later goals are open again (Ersagun 2026-11-09):
a lane takes them when bugs and goal rows are in hand.
Focus since 2026-11-10 14:49 (Ersagun): finish stable references, free lists and multithreading (P1 rows C58, C60, C61, C43; C42, C57, C59 and C200 closed 2026-11-12 as waiting for an example, DONE.md); mobile rows are down to P3.
Defaults first (Ersagun 2026-11-10 15:34): "I want the default compiled code to be as close to a C/C++ dev doing data oriented design and cache and memory aware as possible. And then if we need Pools and similar stuff to get a last 10 percent of performance that's OK, but the defaults should be our first target." So rows that change what every program gets (layout as columns, arrays written in place, records changed in place, work on every core) go before ones a program must ask for (a Pool type).
**Size:** S hours · M one PR · L several PRs or a design note first.
**Status:** ▶ running · ⏸ held · blank = waiting.

## Next up

| lane | thread | next, in order |
|---|---|---|
| E Editor | "Editor lane" | C58 (free lists; a Pool type asked of Ersagun); mobile rows wait. Then Language or Compiler rows agreed with those lanes |
| C Compiler and targets | "Compiler lane" | C195 (relations in WebAssembly and C); C187 is blocked on V8 |
| L Language and library | "Language lane" | the next goal row (stable references, free lists, multithreading) agreed with the lane that holds it; I203's editor half is with the Editor lane (L182 is with the Editor lane) |
| L Language and library | "Language lane B" | the next goal row agreed with its lane (C43's first on C waits for an example); round 12's I187 is with the Editor lane. Skip L107 (waits on Ersagun) and L24 (research). Take a row from another list only after telling that lane. |
| T Testing | "Replace the slow browser smoke test" | I64, then the smoke's replacement |

### Parallel and concurrent code on the targets

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C195 | Relations in WebAssembly and C: a solve has no lowering outside JavaScript, where it is the evaluator's solver or a plan printed as JavaScript text (core-solve.ts, modes.ts), so `ters wasi` and `ters native` stop at "solves a relation (not in this profile yet)" (scalar.ts solveUse). A plan written as code the scalar profile lowers (as `derive` writes a derivative) would reach every target. Example: `ters wasi` of examples/relations, backwards, conjugate and physics printing what `ters run` prints (the other 16 examples with a main that isn't a page already do, 2026-11-06). Surveyed 2026-11-06 04:00 (Language lane, which took the row): no one step gets an example there, since each needs a different kind of solve. relations: split and add are solver plans with one way (`once`), square has two answers, polar is numeric or periodic. backwards: angle is `once`, greet a mode plan, magnitudes to is neither (relate.ts runs it). conjugate: brighter is neither (a conjugation of closures). physics: fall is numeric, rotate periodic. Steps: (a) a `once` solver plan (relation.ts compileSolve's `$one`) and a det or semidet mode plan (modes.ts) written as Ters definitions the scalar profile lowers, with `$clean`'s 12-digit rounding as a builtin on C (`%.12g`) and WASM, `$ok` and `$close` as arithmetic; (b) a solver plan with several answers as a Choice (square); (c) numeric plans (tearing, Newton) as Ters code (polar, fall); (d) solves relate.ts runs (magnitudes to, brighter), each a row if it earns one. Done: (a) for solver plans (C195a, 2026-11-06), (b) for ways without a periodic parameter (C195b, 2026-11-09). Mode plans with one answer or none (greet) done too (C195c, 2026-11-09). Tears of one unknown in a search (physics' fall) done too (torn.ts, 2026-11-09). Periodic ways where only a first takes the answer (physics' rotate), and for some over one predicate, done too (2026-11-10): physics prints on WASM and C what ters run prints. A first of a call of a definition that is one such solve (relations' to polar) writes its body in place there (2026-11-10): relations prints on WASM and C what ters run prints. Relational solves with several answers in a search (backwards' magnitude, every answer as a list, one chosen) and text joined with neither side known (cuts) done too (2026-11-10); backwards' main then stops at read numbers (show numbers unfolded). Found 2026-11-10: relate.ts gives answers by miniKanren's mplus, which takes the next arm's first answer whenever one suspends (each unfolded level, a recursive call), so every answer of an unfold or a recursive mode comes interleaved (square roots of each([4, 9]) is [2 3] [-2 3] [2 -3] [-2 -3]); written code would need that order (a breadth-first queue of suspended arms), or first-only readings. Until then, mode functions giving every answer refuse calls and unfolds. Relational searches depth first, in written order, and every answer of a mode plan with unfolds, cuts, show read back, a function given as a definition and several solver ways (C195f, 2026-11-12): backwards and conjugate print on WASM and C what ters run prints. Left: periodic ways in a search whose every answer counts (all, count). Periodic ways, found 2026-11-09: to polar is a several-answer definition that main reads through first, so the solve is in CPS code, not under the first. The solver's stream goes by levels, L = 0 to 10^4, each the whole plan again with every k from −L to L, giving only answers no earlier one had and stopping at a level L > 0 with none new. Written out exactly, that is a loop over levels, a k list built per level, and a dedup check that runs the plan again over every earlier path, all in CPS: a large step. The cheaper way, level 0 when a first takes the answer, needs the first to be seen through the definition's call (first-arms.ts could carry it). 2026-11-12 (Compiler lane): a conjugate of a function written in place is a solve on the function it calls (#2481), so conjugate's quarter turn about compiles; equations solved together (bands run backwards: a + b and a − b known) are written as the solver's plan for them, each unknown rounded as it rounds (C195e). Conjugate then stops at multiband: bands run backwards has several answers (its otherwise arm takes a one-item list) and calls itself, so it needs the interleaved order too, which the Language lane is writing for backwards | Compiler lane 2026-11-06 (ters wasi survey) | P3 | L | |


### Mobile (Ersagun 2026-11-09: a goal; native compilation per platform a stretch goal, instead of a webview. Down since 2026-11-10 14:49, behind stable references, free lists and multithreading: "Platform stuff will eventually be solved anyway")
